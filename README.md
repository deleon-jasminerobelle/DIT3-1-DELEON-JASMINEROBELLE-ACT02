1. "What did you observe about the app lifecycle when switching between screens or minimizing the app?"
   When moving between screens in an app, the activity you leave is paused or stopped, while the next one becomes active, and when you minimize the app, it enters the background but may be destroyed if resources are low.
   
2. "What did you learn about activity management in Android?"
  From this, I learned that Android uses a lifecycle to manage activities in a back stack, so itâ€™s important to save data and release resources properly to ensure smooth performance and prevent data loss.
